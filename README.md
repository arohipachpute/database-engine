# database-engine
A simple key-value database engine with file persistence and basic query capabilities.
It mimics the functionalities of databases like MySQL, but in a lightweight way. Instead of running a dedicated server, it uses a simple file on disk to store and retrieve key-value pairs, implemented in any programming language.
